        <pre>            This is my song
            And no one can take it away
            It's been so long
            But now you're here
            <br>
            Here to stay
            And I wonder
            If you know what it means
            To find your dreams come true
            <br>
            This is my song
            And no one can make it a lie
            It's been so long
            <br>
            Since someone
            Could make me cry
            And I wonder
            f you know what it means
            TO laugh as tear go by
